# Careful Consideration

Using data analytics to improve my Magic: the Gathering decision game, while learning data science tech on the side.

I've done this in a couple different ways:

- deck_sampler.py takes a decklist and generates a lot of opening hands, then it does some statistical analysis on that to see if the manabase is adequate, for instance.
- decks_notebook.py is a Jupyter Notebook to analyze deck performance in a large tournament; it takes some tournament results and some way to determine performance (I used day 2 percentage) and then makes nice stats and graphs out of them.

An example from gp_ghent_results_notebook.py
